# Homework 4

## 4.1 -> Design the Scotch Yoke Mechanism taking the course videos as reference (especially the slider crank mechanism; in this one can see why it’s important to use Fusion Rule Number 1)
## 4.2 -> Choose ONE mechanism from the list and design it in Fusion.
   
### 	Requirements for 2 and 3:
	Divide the mechanism into components
	Use Fusion Rule Number 1
	Design the model having in mind that it will be 3D printed (Create a stand for the mechanism - like “Holder” component made in Course 5 videos - so they will not levitate)
	Use suggestive names for your bodies, components, sketches, joints, contact points, construction planes or any element that you include in your project
	Add appearances
	Add joints
	Create a motion study
	Render the mechanism (upload a rendering photo to GitHub as well)
	OBS: Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history is not turned on). You need to upload the project as .f3d and a .stl for each projects’ body and component.
	BONUS:  Make a video rendering with the mechanism displaying the motion study. Use the result to make a video tutorial where you present how the mechanism is working.
