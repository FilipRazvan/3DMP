## Scissor lifts are a type of mechanism that allows for vertical displacement of some load, through the use of linked, folding supports, in a crisscross “X” pattern, referred to as a pantograph (or, simply, a scissor mechanism). Scissor lifts are widely used in industrial applications, and also form a staple design element in competitive robotics.
### The Mechanism is driven by a manually operated screw.
